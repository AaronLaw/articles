我曾问过《笨办法学Python》的作者Zed Shaw：要想掌握编程应该读哪5本书？他是这么回答我的。

> “想着读五本书就掌握编程了？根本没有这样的书单。不管你想熟练掌握什么技能，你都得常年累月地不断练习。——Zed Shaw

刚听到这个回复的时候，我有点不高兴。但是Zed并不是在跟我开玩笑，他是真的这么认为。

对我而言，支持我“常年累月地不断练习”的唯一方法，就是保持这件事的有趣。我们的大脑并不适合常年从事一些没意思的工作。我们渴望新奇和有趣的东西。要想常年坚持做一件事，我们就必须学会顺从我们的天性。

Gmail的发明者Paul Buchheit在《The Two Paths to Sucess》一文中这样说道：

> 我取得成功的战略可以浓缩成两条准侧：1. 想办法让一件事变得有趣；2. 如果事情没成功，想办法应对。

为了让“常年累月地不断练习”这件事变得更有层次，我会做一些副项目（side projects）。副项目在包括编程在内的任何创意领域中有占据着独特的位置。它们的地位很重要，因为它们给你提供了进行试验自己想法和从错误中学习的机会。

在从事副项目时，我总是时不时提醒自己要遵守一些准则。如果我忘记了遵守它们，那这个项目就不再有趣了，这意味着我会暂时停止这个项目。建议你在做副项目的时候，也牢记这些准则。

## 从错误中学习

孩提时代的我们，学习速度最快。出生时你一个单词都不会，到了6岁的时候就学会了1万个单词了；这就是说你平均每天学会5个新单词！孩子和成人的一个关键区别，就是成年人如果没有立即取得完美的成绩就会责怪自己。如果一个孩子失败了，通常也只会孩子的家长会担心。所有的孩子都知道，失败只会带来暂时的疼痛。他们不会纠结于这件事。

> “每一个错误都是一个绝佳的启示，因为每个错误都会指出你需要特别思考的地方。这可以将你的思维方式，从找到正确地解决方案（困难）转移到纠正一个特定得问题（容易）。” —— Starbird & Burger，5 Elements of Effective Thinking。

要允许自己犯错。副项目的一大自由就是你又可以成为一名初学者。你不会有预期。你可以犯错误，全心全意地去学习。只有当你犯了错误之后，你才会深刻地知道下次不应该做什么。

根据Bloom的学习分类法，通过阅读和倾听所学到的内容中，你只会记住20%，而你真正实践过的事情则会记住90%。更高的参与程度以及错误-反馈循环可以让你真正地发现一个问题的要害。

According to Bloom's Taxonomy of learning, you only retain 20% of what you read/hear but 90% of what you do. The higher level of engagement and the mistake feedback loop allows you to truly flesh out the problem's nooks for yourself. No description can be detailed enough to explain every single aspect of completing even the simplest of side projects. Only by sitting down and navigating the maze of micro-decisions will you actually learn the real texture of the problem.

Kill the Boring Bits
Working on your side project should be as fun as possible. What annoys you while working on your side project? Build environment sucks? Editor highlighting hurts your eyes? Deploying is a tedious and painful? Automate it!

A specific examples from my own life.

I randomly come up with ideas for my projects during my commute or waiting in line. Usually the idea ends up a reciept or a random post-it with the best of intentions. Due to my lack of organization, these bits of paper just end up disappearing or chewed up by our washing machine. Fed up with the situation, I decided to setup a little daemon that watches my email inbox. When I come up with a new idea, I email it to myself and the daemon transfers it into my organization/todo system automatically every night. Not only did my pain get solved, I learned a lot about the Emacs.

If worst comes to worst, just give up and don't do that bit unless absolutely essential. Anything that feels like pulling teeth will kill your motivation. Do it consistently and you won't want to work on the side project anymore. You must keep it fun.

Go Big or Not
Gmail is a great example of a side project that went huge. That was by choice. My computer is a graveyard of half baked ideas and empty directories, all created in moments of inspiration. It's up to you. You're in full control. If you want to get big, go for it. If you want to keep it small and run it for friends and family, go for it. You are a omnipotent deity. Being in charge gives you confidence in your own judgement.

If you're starting to feel restless or don't want to work on that project anymore, archive it, write a blog post, put it on github or just give a major fist pump and declare victory because you learned what you wanted.

You are the captain of your own ship and the master of your own destiny.

“When you’re working on a side project, you have the time and the choice to invest in learning new things ... You can also be choosier about the feedback you take.
 When you do take it, it’s because you truly want to get better at something.”
- Tobias van Schneider
Tutorials, books and lectures are great when you're starting out because they give you a mental framework to hang your hat on. After that, side projects become much much more efficient.

Side Project Rules To Live By
Remember these rules when you're working on your projects.

1) Learn From Mistakes
2) Kill The Boring Bits
3) Go Big Or Not
4) Have Fun!
Because why would you waste your extremely limited and valuable time on anything else?
