a woman in purple hoodie, slouched over her keyboard with her desk full of empty mugs and bottles
In the next office over sat a tired employee, with dozens of empty coffee cups, slouched over, typing angrily.
Hi, said little printf.
The woman didn't stop what she was doing. She kept typing furiously.
Hello? he asked again.
The woman stopped at once, got a flask out of a drawer in her desk, and took a swig.
I have a terrible job, she said. I do devops. It started okay, where I'd mostly develop and then sometimes debug stuff, but as time moved on, it got worse and worse. I started fighting fires in our stack, and then more fires kept happening. I got rid of most of them, pulling small miracles here and there to then meet the deadlines on dev stuff I also had to do
And did they hire anyone to help?
No, that's the thing. Small fires kept happening here and there, and because of the time I took to fight them, I couldn't be as careful as before with the dev stuff, so I created more fires all the time. Now I'm fighting fires all day and all night and I hate my job
Why doesn't your employer do anything?
I'm good at my job, and I managed to keep things under control long enough that everyone got used to it. When you make a habit of small miracles, people get used to it. Then you're stuck doing miracles all the time or they will think you won't do your job at all.
That sounds very sad
It is; and because you're the most familiar person with these fires, you get to only work on them more and more, until your employer hires someone else to cover your old job, the one you loved. If you care hard enough about your work to be the one doing the stuff everyone else hates, you're thanked by doing more and more of that work you don't like, until that's all you do. And then there's nothing left for you to enjoy.
Then you're unlucky, said little printf.
And her pager went off again.
That woman, said little printf to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, that woman would be scorned by all the others: by the senior expert, by the rockstar developer, by the serial early adopter. Nevertheless she is the only one of them all who seems helpful. Perhaps that is because she is thinking of something else besides herself.”
