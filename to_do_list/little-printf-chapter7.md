a man at his desk in front of two monitors
The fourth workspace my friend visited had a man whose computer was covered in so many stickers nobody could tell what brand it was.
motor-mvc, quadrangular JS, GoQuery, cometeor, some japanese soundy thing, ...
Hi, interrupted printf. What are you doing?
alchemist, bongodb, mochascript, walktime.js, portasql, ..., the man kept going
What are you doing?, he asked again, louder this time.
Oh, I'm trying out new frameworks, tools, databases, languages.
Whoa, you seem to be going fast, maybe as fast as 10 programmers put together!
yes! well, the industry moves so very fast!, he looked at his phone for a second, and added there! the cardboard.io framework came up with version 3.5 which broke compatibility with 3.4 and this yielded 4 forks in the community! I have to try them all to know which to choose!
and what do you do learning all of these?
I'm an early adopter. If you don't stay up to date you get stuck writing COBOL or MUMPS for a living. You want to find the next big thing, and ride the wave to the top!
Has it ever worked?
Oh yes! I found out about Rails before it got big, and I figured out node.js before it was popular, and I was on the first beta copies of redis and mongodb and riak! I was the first one to use vagrant and then I got us to switch to docker but of course now it's all about unikernels..
Cool, and all these things you were at the forefront of, how did it pay off?
oh it didn't; by the time rails became huge I had moved on to the next big thing so I didn't get left behind. Similarly for the other ones. Here's hoping for unikernels though
I see, added little printf, pensively. What problems do you solve with all of these frameworks?
Oh, I make sure we don't use something that is not going to be big, so that this company doesn't get to bet on technologies that have no future. It's very important work, because if you don't do that, you can't find anyone to hire except old grey beards behind the times, and you want self-motivated go-getters, who are also early adopters., said the man.
That is funny, chimed our friend.
It is very hard! in the startup world, if you want a-players, you need good technology to bring them in! Otherwise you're stuck with inflexible laggards. Nobody wants to be an inflexible laggard.
The little printf interjected: No, that's not what I mean, and he then added I mean it's funny that tools are meant to solve problems for us, but for you, the tools themselves have become a problem.
And while the man stood there in silence (on his new cool treadmill desk), little printf hopped out of the room.
