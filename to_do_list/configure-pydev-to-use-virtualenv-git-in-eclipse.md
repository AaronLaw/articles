Configure PyDev for Productivity

Go to Window → Preferences. Open PyDev and select Editors (actually click on 'Editors', don't just expand it). In the Appearance Color Options dropdown menu, select Comments. Then change it to a brighter color (perhaps fuchsia?).


Turn on Task view  to show TODO: items and add a CONSIDER: tag

Go to Window → Show View → Tasks.
Window → Preferences → PyDev → Task Tags, and add CONSIDER: to the end of the list.
To get the task tags to show, run the program once, or select Project → Clean
