@_ericelliott Immutability is when you have a cake and want to eat a piece, you bake a new cake to eat from, leaving the first cake alone.

A recent twitter challenge asked us to: “Describe a functional programming term in a tweet”.
Enter the Functional Neighbours. Your lovably personified functional concepts! Illustrated by my lovely friend Caroline Chapple

Map is your baby brother. You lend him your toys, they all come back covered in snot and paint.

Reduce is your awesome mechanic neighbour. You loan her all your tools, nuts and bolts. She returns you a go-cart.

Filter is your younger sister. You loan her a bunch of stuff and only get some of it back.

Pattern Matching is your cousin who always has 2 odd socks, a Hawaiian shirt, and super man underpants.

Currying is your pension manager. You give her all your money and she lets you have it back, one buck at a time.

Higher Order Functions are your granny at Christmas. She’ll take your shit but by god she’ll give back just as good.
