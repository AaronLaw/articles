If you have an affinity for clothing adorned with perfectly coordinated and programmed LED lights, you're going to want to find Kassandra Perch at the next conference you are at. Kassandra made a significant impact on the conference circuit this year, speaking and presenting at conferences like Nodevember, JSConf and JavaScript Summit. Her passion for all things embedded with JavaScript really comes through in her new book which is perfect for anyone who has worked with Arduino before or is new to electronics and would like to try writing sketches in JavaScript.

7. Chris Williams and Laura Williams
The forces behind the magic that is JSConf, Chris Williams and Laura Williams ran not one, but two memorable JSConfs in 2015. Whether it's through robots, creating safe spaces or stepping outside of the standard conference playbook, Chris and Laura have shown us this year what can really be achieved when people that love the community and JS come together. Although they will no longer be organizing JSConf US– we can't wait to see what they will do next!

17. Reginald Braithewaite
Perhaps one of the most worthwhile and perceptive Twitter accounts out there, Reginald Braithewaite is someone you want to pay close attention to (if you aren't already). In addition to his tremendous work on GitHub, his site offers developers an array of technical and non-technical, relevant insights. We also want to mention Reginald's JavaScript Allongé that is a must read for anyone looking to connect the ever-elusive dots of JavaScript.
