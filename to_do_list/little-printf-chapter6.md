nondescript programmer sitting back to the viewer in the dark, with a sandwich on their desk

During the time that would have been lunch break, Printf interrupted a person who had seemingly forgotten to eat their lunch, a sandwich growing cold by the minute, while sitting at their desk and looking at their screen.

That seemed like quite a busy person who might have known what they were doing. Printf asked:

If a primary database can fail, can the follower fail too?

Everything you run, the person said, can and will sooner or later fail.
Even the things telling you things have failed?
Yes, even these ones. All large systems are in some state of partial failure at any given time.
Then, trying to make reliable systems, what use is it?
The person did not know, for at that moment, they were trying to answer a page for the sky falling out onto their head due to a broken cloud, wondering the same thing.
Then making reliable systems, what use is it? pressed little Printf again
Upset as the person was dealing with a production issue, with this kid not letting go and a sandwich going to waste, the person impatiently shot back:
It's of no use at all. Programming is all shit anyway.
oh!, he gasped.
Then there was a moment of complete silence.
a garbage can on fire with a golden plate saying 'programming' on it
The little guy responded, with a hint of resent:
I don't believe you. Programs are fragile, but programmers can make good efforts and make things better and useful.
No answer came back. At that point the person had opened the document explaining how to boot a new copy of the whole cluster from scratch, and things seemed to go from bad to worse.
And you actually believe good reliable prog-
Oh no! the person said. No no no! I don't believe in good or reliable programs! Not anymore! They're all terrible! I just told you the first thing that came to my head because I'm dealing with one of these shitty systems right now. Don't you see I'm trying to keep this stuff running? This shit is actually of consequence.
Printf stared back, with a shocked expression.
Actually of consequence? You talk just like a 'real programmer'.
He added:
You mix everything up, confuse everything. There's been millions of programs, and for years they've been running and failing just the same. And people have used them and needed them. And I know of some programs that run nowhere but on a single laptop, and in a single mistake could destroy entire communities, without even noticing. And you think that this is not important?
The person remained silent.
