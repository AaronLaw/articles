# PyDevs：Python开发者Ben Rousch

The PyDev of the Week this week is Ben Rousch (@brousch). He is a contributor to the Kivy project. You should check out his blog here. You can also see Mr. Rousch give a talk about Kivy on Youtube. Let’s find out more about him!

Can you tell us a little about yourself (hobbies, education, etc):

## 你能简单介绍下自己吗？（爱好，教育背景等）

过去15年中，我一个人充当了Van Dam Iron Works公司的整体IT部。这是一商用和工业用钢制楼梯制造商。我是密歇根大学人类学学士。我的编程和IT技巧大部分是自学的，从互联网和编程书中获益不少。我业余时间大部分花在参加和组织用户组见面会，以及探索当天我最感兴趣的技术上。

For the past 15 years I’ve been the entire IT department for Van Dam Iron Works, a manufacturer of commercial and industrial steel stairs and railings in Grand Rapids, MI. I have a BS in Anthropology from the University of Michigan. My programming and IT skills are largely self taught, with a lot of help from the Internet and books. Much of my free time is spent attending and organizing user group meetings and playing with whatever technology catches my interest that day.

## 你为什么开始使用Python？

Why did you start using Python?

大概在2000年的时候，我还在使用Visual Basic和PHP做很多事，但是随着我写的程序越来越大，对它们感到越来越失望，所以我就开始寻找一门更好的编程语言。我首先试了Python，但错误地通过Zope和Plone来学习——这两个都是大型框架，让我对Python望而却步。我后来使用了几年的Java和C#，用过很短时间的Ruby。之后我又回到了Python，主要是写一些比较小的脚本和尝试像CherryPy这样的框架。后来我就一直坚持使用Python，因为我可以用它来编写任何我需要开发的程序。

In the early 2000s I was using Visual Basic and PHP for a lot of things, but became frustrated with it as my programs got larger, so I went in search of a better programming language. I tried Python first, but made the mistake of trying to learn it via Zope and Plone – giant frameworks that really turned me off from it. I had multi-year bouts with Java and C# with Mono, and a very brief stint with Ruby, before coming back around to Python via smaller scripts and frameworks like CherryPy. I’ve stuck with Python because I can use it for nearly any program I need to create.

## 你还知道哪些编程语言，你最喜欢哪一个？

What other programming languages do you know and which is your favorite?

我以前非常熟悉PHP，但是很久没有用过了。我会一点JavaScript——任何Web开发者都必须会一点，还懂一点用Java做安卓开发。Python是唯一一门我能说精通的语言。

I used to know PHP pretty well, but haven’t used it in a long time. I do a little bit with Javascript – as any web developer must, and a little with Java for Android development. Python is the only language I would say that I know well.

## 你现在在做什么项目？

What projects are you working on now?

在公司，我在尝试用Django来取代老掉牙的微软Access程序。在家里，我通常会用Kivy写一些安卓程序。我的最终目标是发布一款用于安卓开发的Kivy IDE，让你利用Kivy安卓机器上开发安卓程序。最近，我也开始对树莓派和Arduino等嵌入式平平台感兴趣。我现在有一些大型项目的想法，但目前还在做一些小型的试验，验证一些概念，逐步熟悉这门技术。

At work, I’m replacing an old line of business MS Access program mostly with Django. At home I’m often playing with small Kivy apps on Android. Ultimately I hope to release a Kivy IDE on Android, so you can make Android apps on Android using Kivy, dawg. Recently I’ve gotten interested in embedded platforms like Raspberry Pi and Arduino. I have some big projects in mind, but right now I’m mostly doing small proof-of-concepts to familiarize myself with the technology.

Which Python libraries are your favorite (core or 3rd party)?

## 你最喜欢哪些Python库（自带库或第三方库）？

Kivy或Django是我最近几乎每个Python项目中都会用的库。如果是开发移动或桌面图像应用的话，我使用Kivy。如果是开发Web应用，我会用Django。

Kivy or Django are what I end up using on nearly every Python project these days. If it’s a mobile or desktop GUI app, I use Kivy. If it’s a web app, I use Django.

Is there anything else you’d like to say?
