
This guide provides tips and resources to help you develop your technical skills (academically and non-academically) through self-paced, hands-on learning.

## Take an “Introduction to CS” course

Focus on basic coding instructions
Online resources:

Udacity - Introduction to Computer Science
Coursera - Computer Science 101

## Code in (at least) ONE object-oriented programming language

Beginner online resources:
Coursera - Learn to Program: The Fundamentals
MIT Intro to Programming in Java
Google's Python Class
Coursera - Introduction to Python, Python Open Source E-Book
Intermediate online resources:

Udacity's Design of Computer Programs
Coursera - Learn to Program: Crafting Quality Code, Coursera - Programming Languages
Brown University - Introduction to Programming Language

## Learn other programming languages

Add to your repertoire:
JavaScript®
CSS & HTML
Ruby®
PHP®
C®
Perl®
Shell® script
Lisp®
Scheme®

## Test your code

Learn how to catch bugs, create tests, and break your software

## Develop logical reasoning and knowledge of discrete math

Learn about fundamental data types (stack, queues, and bags), sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, heapsort), data structures (binary search trees, red-black trees, hash tables), and Big O.

## Develop a strong knowledge of operating systems

Online resources:
UC Berkeley Computer Science 162

## Learn UX design

Online resources:

## Work on a small piece of a large system (codebase), read and understand existing code, track down documentation, and debug

GitHub is a great way to read other people’s code or contribute to a project
Online resources:

GitHub®
Kiln™

## Work on projects with other programmers

This will help you improve your ability to work well in a team and enable you to learn from others.

## Practice your algorithmic knowledge and coding skills

Practice your algorithmic knowledge through coding competitions like CodeJam or ACM’s International Collegiate Programming Contest.
Online resources:
