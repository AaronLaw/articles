Chapter 4
a building
He went to a workspace, looking for experienced developers from whom to get tips and help.
The first one he met was a very proud senior engineer who seemed to feel rather superior.
a balding man in a suit, with thick glasses
Ah, here comes a learner! Welcome to my domain, of which I am the expert he said.
An expert? Little printf asked. Does this mean you can program anything and everything?
Yes! the expert answered. He added Well almost; I only program programs that are worth programming. I don't lose my time on trivialities. Many programs I have never written but could write with all the ease in the world.
Ah, so could you help me with my system? As soon as the little printf started explaining his business, the domain expert interrupted him:
I'm sorry, but I don't really see the point of doing that.
Why not?
Experience. I am good at programming the things I program, and I program things I am good at. By getting better at this fairly restricted set of things I'm already good at, I make sure I'm more valuable than ever at it. Call it job security, call it survival of the fittest, but that's how I roll.
And why can't you help me?
Well you see, taking my time away to help you means I divert important self-investment into furthering the progress of others — that's a losing strategy for me. The best way to learn for you is the way I took myself: struggle very hard and figure it out yourself. It helps forge character.
That doesn't seem very efficient...
Well you can go to school and learn, or you can learn on your own. Really what it does is weed out the lazy people who just want it easy, and forces everyone who stays here to be those who really deserve it. The moment we let moochers in, the very value of the work I produce goes down with it.
Do you not think cooperation or colleagues could help you?
Not really. I work best when left alone and not being distracted. Every time I end up forced working with others, it's nigh impossible to get our stuff working together. Out of exasperation, I grab their work and rewrite most of it in a sane way; then it works right.
Little printf was surprised to meet an expert who seemed so disinterested in helping others, yet so annoyed by their perceived lack of skill. It was a bit sad that this man narrowed his vision of himself to just the one area he knew, to the point where he didn't do anything else than create problems for himself to fix!
I see... well I guess I'm happy you won't give me your help, said my little friend
What do you mean? asked the meritocratic man, whose value seemed suddenly downgraded. Don't you think the work I do is interesting?
Oh that I do. It just seems like you would see me as a hindrance and annoyance more than anything else, and what I am looking for is help, not affliction.
And little printf left swiftly, leaving the expert to realize he had made himself untouchable in more ways than just his job security.
