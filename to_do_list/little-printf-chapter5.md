Chapter 5
a man sitting at his desk in front of multiple filled bookcases
On his way, little printf went in front of the door to an office occupied by a man surrounded by thick hardcover books, with fancy images on them like wizards and dragons and fractals and mathematical patterns.
Nice books, sir, said printf
Thanks. I think they're essential material for programmers. If you don't have them, you're not really a pro
I guess I'm not a pro then, said little printf. Which one is your favorite?
Oh, well I haven't read most of them.
Are you not a good programmer then?
No, I am not. The developer proudly added: In fact, I'm a terrible programmer.
That's a shame, said little printf, who continued: I'm getting better myself.
Have you heard of the Dunning-Kruger effect?, asked the man.
No, what is it?
It's a cognitive bias thing. It basically says that people who are less competent tend to overestimate their qualifications, and people who are competent tend to systemically underestimate theirs.
So if I think I'm getting better, I'm probably not great
Yeah, exactly. You're probably bad. On the other hand, I openly say I'm a terrible programmer. But according to Dunning-Kruger, I'm probably underestimating myself, and that makes me a good developer, don't you see?
I guess?
That's because self-deprecation is a vital tool of the developer. The moment you feel you're good, you relax and stop improving.
Doesn't this mean that the moment you feel good about yourself, you're on your way to failure and then you should feel bad?
yes. But the way to go about this is to say that everything is terrible, even if you have no solutions to offer. That way you look smart, but don't have much to contribute.
What do you mean?
Say I go online and see a project I dislike. The trick is to point out everything that is wrong, give no more information than that. You can probably subtly point ways in which the person who did the thing is an idiot and get away with it.
And how is anyone better for this?
Well I like to think they are better for knowing they're on the wrong track, and I'm better off for showing them that. It's a bit of smoke and mirrors. Nobody knows what they're doing but that way it looks like I do.
And what happens when you are asked for help and can't do anything about it?
That's when you go back to saying everything is terrible; you have too much yak shaving to do, improving other things, and being overly pessimistic. They're on their own.
So this is all posturing? You're gaming your way through? You're the person who pretends to be incompetent at things they know, which makes people who actually know nothing there feel even worse, and you're the person who pretends to be competent at things you don't know, so that people trying to improve there also feel bad.
In any case, competence has very little to do with it. Reputation is pretty important though. People hire friends, and people who aren't liked and non-essential get fired first; try to change the system and you become disliked. It's all a very social game. It's how it works in the industry, and probably in academia too, though I wouldn't know, now would I? It's all about who you know, selling yourself, your own personal brand you know? That's how you get jobs in the business.
If this is how things are and that you must feel bad and make others feel bad to do well, maybe I don't want a job in the business, said little printf, before walking out.
