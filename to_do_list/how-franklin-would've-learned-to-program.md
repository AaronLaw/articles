# How Benjamin Franklin Would've Learned To Program

# 本杰明·富兰克林会怎样学习编程？

Good programming is notoriously difficult to teach. Programming books generally all start out in the same way: "Here is an example of an X, and here is an example.". Teaching the building blocks is easy. There are only so many. The hard part is teaching the consequences of each choice. The common advice is to write a lot of code to get good. This is necessary but not sufficient. To learn we still need to decide what code to write, and how to improve that code.

优秀的编程方法是极难教的。编程书籍大抵都是这样开头的：“这是X方法的例子，这里也是一个例子”。教教基础是容易的，因为基础知识也就那么多。难就难在，要教会每种选择带来的结果。一般我们会建议多写代码，慢慢提高水平。这是必要但不是充分条件。想继续学习，我们仍然需要觉得写哪些代码，以及如何改善这些代码。

We will explore the closely related field of writing to get advice on improving our craft. In many ways programming is like writing. Both are centrally concerned with getting your thoughts down into an easily communicated form. We find both hard because our ideas are densly cross-linked whereas text is depressingly linear. The infinite variety of ways in which thoughts can be represented in text makes learning the art of writing, as well as programming, difficult.

我们接下来转向与编程紧密相关的领域——写作，寻求改善技艺的灵感。从很多方面看，编程就像是写作。二者的核心关注点，都是以容易沟通的形式表达自己的思想。我们会发现二者都很困难，因为我们的思想是高度密集交错的，而文本又是极其的线性化。利用文本，我们有无数中表达思想的方法，这使得学习写作的艺术，以及编程的艺术，变得困难。

Thankfully, Benjamin Franklin recorded a method that he used to develop proficiency. As evidence of his writing prowess, we need only look at the Amazon Biography best seller's list. His biography is still one of the best selling books after x hundred years. If that's not proof then I don't know what is.

幸运地是，本杰明·富兰克林记录下了他锻炼写作技巧的方法。我们只需要查看Amazon网站上传记畅销书单，就会发现富兰克林的写作能力之高。数百年后，他的自传仍位居畅销书之列。如果这都证明不了他的写作能力，我不知道到底还有什么可以证明。

Benjamin developed his method in his early teens and worked hard at practicing his craft. Here is the exceprt with a few added line breaks for legibility.

本杰明在少年时期就找到了练习的方法，并且一直刻苦地练习写作。下面是他的自传中相关介绍的摘录。为了方便大家阅读，我将原文分隔成了多个段落。


> About this time I met with an odd volume of the Spectator. It was the third. I had never before seen any of them. I bought it, read it over and over, and was much delighted with it. I thought the writing excellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it.

With this view I took some of the papers, and, making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, try'd to compleat the papers again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should come to hand. Then I compared my Spectator with the original, discovered some of my faults, and corrected them.

But I found I wanted a stock of words, or a readiness in recollecting and using them, which I thought I should have acquired before that time if I had gone on making verses; since the continual occasion for words of the same import, but of different length, to suit the measure, or of different sound for the rhyme, would have laid me under a constant necessity of searching for variety, and also have tended to fix that variety in my mind, and make me master of it. Therefore I took some of the tales and turned them into verse; and, after a time, when I had pretty well forgotten the prose, turned them back again. I also sometimes jumbled my collections of hints into confusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the best order, before I began to form the full sentences and compleat the paper. This was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts.

> 大约在这时候，我偶然看到了一本《旁观者》的零本，是第三册。在这以前，我从未曾看见过这个刊物。我买了这本散册，反复读了几遍，十分中意，我认为文章写得好极了，如果可能的话，我想模仿它的风格。

> 因此我从中选了几篇文章，简要地摘录下了每一句的大意，接着把它们搁置几天，然后不看原书，用我自己想得起来的合适辞句，把每一个句子尽量完整地表达出来，又凑成整篇的文章，使它表达得像以前一样地完整。然后我把我自己写的《旁观者》与原来的比较，发现了一些我的缺点，作了修正。

> 但是我发现我的词汇贫乏，或是说我不能很快地想起适当的词来用。我想，假如我以前没有放弃写诗的话，那时候我的词汇一定会丰富得多了，因为经常不断地有机会寻找具有同样意义而有不同长度的词去适合诗的韵律，或是不同音素的词去凑韵脚，会迫使我不断地搜索具有不同形式的同义词，会有助于我记忆这些不同的词并使我掌握它们。因此，我把其中的一些故事改写成了诗，过了一些时候，当我差不多已经遗忘了原来的散文的时候，我又把它们重新还原。有时候我也把我摘录的思想搞乱了，经过几个星期以后，设法把它们用最好的次序排列起来，然后再把它们写成完整的句子，组合成文章。这样做，是为了教我如何整理思想的方法


The Benjamin Franklin Programming Practice Model

## 本杰明·富兰克林式编程练习模式

Find a program that you greatly admire and read it.
