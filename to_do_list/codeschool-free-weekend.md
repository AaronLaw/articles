# 福利 | Codeschool全部课程免费 周末狂欢赚学分

提前声明，编程派和Codeschool的网站没有任何关系，我只是看过他们的几套视频课程，觉得做得都挺有意思(每个课程都有片头曲配动画)，课程难度也不高。因此，最近看到了他们将在周末免费开放全部课程的消息，想要推荐给大家。

如果你认为自己的英语听力水平还不错，可以接着看下去。如果你认为听英文有困难，我还是建议尝试一下一边学编程一边学英语，当然这可能会比较痛苦。如果你受不了这个痛苦，那就让转给需要的人吧。

We’ve reached 2 million students now learning at Code School, so to celebrate, we’re making all our content free this weekend! Create a free account now to participate or sign in to get a reminder when Free Weekend begins.

Win a Free Year of Code School

We’ll have a public leaderboard tracking course points earned by every student during Free Weekend — the top 10 point-earners of the weekend will receive a free year of Code School! 

If you like what you see this weekend, Code School’s normal pricing is $29 per month. There’s also a free tier, but it limits your access to the first level on the courses.

These courses won’t give you all the skills you need to land a job, but they’re a good way to dig into learning how to code.
