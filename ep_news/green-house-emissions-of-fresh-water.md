Greenhouse gas emissions from freshwater higher than thought

千万不要小看了潺潺溪流。这些静静的流水也是有可能产生大量的温室气体的。

根据Ecological Monographs杂志发布的一项最新研究，Wisconsin-Madison大学的研究人员发现全球各地的河流排放至大气中的甲烷气体比之前研究的预计要高出10倍。新研究同时还发现，人类活动看上去决定了哪些河流排放的甲烷气体最多。

这份研究的主要作者是Wisconsin-Madison大学的Emily Stanley教授，她告诉我们：“科学家们已经确认，像湖泊和水库这样的内陆水体是甲烷气体的一大来源”。不过，目前想对这些来源排放的甲烷气体数量进行测量好还很困难。

和二氧化碳一样，甲烷也是一种可以将热量截留在地表的温室气体。虽然在大气中的占比不像二氧化碳那么高，但是产生的效果却更明显：一个甲烷分子的热量截留效果比一个二氧化碳分子的效果要大的多。因此，弄清楚到底有多少甲烷被排放至大气中，可以帮助科学家更准确地得出应对全球气候变暖所需的预算，从而采取更好地俄方式来缓解甲烷造成的影响。


Rivers and streams haven’t received much attention in accounting for that budget, Stanley says, because they don’t take up much surface area on a global scale and, with respect to methane, didn’t seem to be all that gassy. But over the years, measurements taken by Stanley and her lab members seemed to indicate these sources may produce more methane than scientists had previously known.

Together with other center researchers and scientists at the University of Winnipeg and the U.S. Geological Survey’s LandCarbon Project, the team created a database of measured methane flux (the exchange of the gas between water and atmosphere) and methane concentrations measured in streams and rivers using data from 111 publications and three unpublished datasets.

The research team then used two different methods to calculate the best estimates of global methane emissions from the data. They found the emissions to be an order of magnitude higher than scientists had previously reported.

The result was “very surprising,” Stanley says. “I thought maybe we’d be off by a factor of two, so I was taken aback by how much higher the estimate was.”

The researchers pointed to one possible reason: Not every stream is identical. The analysis revealed noticeably higher methane emissions from streams and rivers in watersheds marked with heavy agriculture, urban development or the presence of dams. This suggests efforts to improve stream health may have the added benefit of reducing greenhouse gases.

“The fact that human activity in a watershed leads to high methane concentrations in those rivers and streams underscores yet another reason to pay attention to water quality,” says Stanley. “On top of everything else, it adds to this climate problem, too.”

Methane from freshwater is often a byproduct of bacterial metabolism, as they break down organic matter under low-oxygen conditions, like in the sediment at the bottom of a lake. As the climate warms, the contribution of greenhouse gases from natural sources likes rivers, streams and wetlands is expected to increase because higher temperatures accelerate this bacterial breakdown, releasing more carbon dioxide and methane.

The next step, says Stanley, is figuring out where all that methane comes from. Running rivers and streams are usually better aerated and full of oxygen, making all that methane a bit of a mystery. Is it coming from groundwater? Somewhere along a riverbank? At the bottom of the stream itself? For now, the babbling brook is keeping that information to itself.
