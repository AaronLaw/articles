### Overcast（iOS）

http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/4/8724949/best-podcast-app-iphone-outcast-pocket-casts-castro

If you’ve got an iPhone, the best podcast app is Overcast. It’s got a clean, straightforward, and tasteful design that’s easy to use and never gets in the way of what’s most important: the listening experience. Even better, it has some really nice features which substantially improve that experience.

Smart Speed gets rid of silent moments and dead air wherever they exist in your podcasts, and this can significantly cut down the overall playing time. It saves you precious minutes and eventually hours; when you check Overcast’s settings menu to see exactly how much time; you’ll definitely be surprised. Another feature, Voice Boost, normalizes the volume on both ends of a conversation so no one is too loud or too quiet. Podcasts aren’t always created equal when it comes to production values, so this can be a big help in sparing your ears. If you’re the type who prefers listening to your shows sped up, Overcast’s audio engine delivers the most natural-sounding results we’ve heard. Whereas some other players can make it all too obvious that you’re manipulating speed, Overcast manages to play shows faster without sacrificing quality.

Power users can build playlists with custom smart filters, configure preferences on a show-by-show basis, or set a sleep timer if you’re listening to a podcast before dozing off at night. And when it comes to discovering new shows, Overcast will pull in recommendations from Twitter, and it also groups new podcasts and established hits into helpful “starter kits” that you can subscribe to with a single tap.

The only real limitation of Overcast is that you can’t stream podcasts on the fly; the entire episode must be downloaded before you hit the play button. This can be frustrating at times, but also guarantees you won’t be bothered with unexpected pauses or buffering. The app is available on iPhone and iPad, and there’s also a barebones web player available for your laptop. Overcast also features one of the best Apple Watch apps we’ve seen yet. With it, you can quickly start playing a new show from your wrist, recommend an episode, and access settings for Smart Speed and Voice Boost. Paired with Apple’s Now Playing glance, it’s a pretty convenient setup.

### Pocket Casts（Android）

It’s a feature-rich, powerful app that makes subscribing to shows and setting up automatic downloads a snap. It also syncs across platforms with the iOS version of Pocket Casts, making it ideal if you move between an Android phone and an iPad.

Above just being a vehicle for your podcasts, the standout aspect of Pocket Casts is definitely its design. It’s a tremendous showcase for Google’s Material Design, with fluid animations and color schemes that shift colors based on a podcast’s artwork. Your subscriptions are arranged in a tiled screen with big, beautiful artwork for every show, and Pocket Casts has a seemingly endless array of preferences, playlist filters, and auto-download settings, so you can tailor it fully to your liking. It also has functions for smart speed and volume normalization, but Pocket Casts doesn’t pull them off quite as well as some other apps.

Pocket Casts will work with video podcasts in addition to audio, offers full AirPlay / Chromecast support, and makes discoverability easy with trending podcasts, curated recommendations, and more. The entire package blows away every other option on Android — and that’s not to say those podcast apps are bad; it just speaks of Pocket Cast’s meticulous focus on design and user experience. There’s no free version here, though; the app will cost you $3.99. You shouldn’t hesitate in paying so little for such a powerful player.
