​Python是一个非常实用、流行的编程语言。与C语言等语言不通，Python是解释型解释型语言，其好处之一就是，可以借助其交互的shell进行探索式地编程。你可以试着输入一些代码，然后马上获得解释器的反馈，而不必专门写一个脚本。但是Python自带的shell也有一些局限性，例如无法自动补全、不能高亮语法等。

但是强大的Python社区在默认shell基础了，进行了扩展，开发了许多漂亮的Python shell。每一个都提供了一个极好的交互性的Python 体验。今天我就为大家介绍4款优秀的python shell。 

## [IPython](http://ipython.org/)

IPython是一个加强版的交互式Python shell，提供了一个丰富的工具集合，帮助你交互式地充分利用Python。


## [bpython](http://bpython-interpreter.org/)

## [DreamPie](http://www.dreampie.org/)

DreamPie was designed from the ground up to bring you a great interactive Python experience:

DreamPie features a new concept for an interactive shell: the window is divided into the history box, which lets you view previous commands and their output, and the code box, where you write your code. This allows you to edit any amount of code, just like in your favorite editor, and execute it when it's ready. You can also copy code from anywhere, edit it and run it instantly.
