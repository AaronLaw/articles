# Github上最受关注的Python开发者

Why follow the top-starred Python GitHub devs?

Following influencers is usually a good practice. It has helped me in multiple ways:

Whenever I run out of inspiration, I look at these influencers and see what they have achieved. This brings back the energy and I am back on my projects

You can follow these influencers to see which events are they attending, what are they reading and what are they working on. This can quickly become a wealth of knowledge in itself.

To some extent, it also provides a human touch to these influencers. By just looking at their profiles, they might come across as some one out of the world. But, when you start folllowing them regularly, you tend to relate yourself with the influencers.
