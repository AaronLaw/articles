software architect sitting at his desk with reams of paper on top of it
At the corner of the building, printf found a large office with big windows giving a stunning view of the area. In it sat an old gentleman with reams of documentation on his desk.
Ah, here comes a developer exclaimed the man, as printf stood in the doorway. Come in!
Looking through the windows, little printf noticed that they were full of writing. With the help of a dry-erase pen, the view to the outside world was masked by tons of circles, arrows, cylinders, and clouds. While it was curious the man needed clouds drawn where real ones could be seen outdoors, the whole ensemble was more intriguing.
What is this?, asked our friend, pointing at the windows.
Oh this? This is our production system! Said the man, not once thinking the question was about the outside world. I am a software architect.
What's a software architect?
Mostly, it's someone who knows how to best structure and coordinates the components of a large system so they all fit together well. It's someone who has to know about databases, languages, frameworks, editors, serialization formats, protocols, and concepts like encapsulation and separation of concerns.
That is very interesting! said little printf, here is someone who can answer all my questions! He glanced at the architecture diagrams. Your system is very impressive. Is it running very fast?
I couldn't tell you, said the architect. It should, though
How's the code then, is it good?
I couldn't tell you
Are the users happy about it?
I couldn't tell you either, I'm afraid
But you're a software architect!
Exactly! But I am not a developer. It is not the architect who goes and writes the modules and classes, combines the libraries. The software architect is much too important to go around touching code. But he talks with programmers and developers, asks them questions, provides them guidance. And if the problem is looking interesting enough, the architect takes over the planning.
And why is that?
Because we are more experienced. We know more about systems and what works or not. Developers can then be an extension of our knowledge to produce great systems!
But how do you know if things are going well without getting involved with code?
We trust the developers
So you trust them to implement your ideas correctly, but not enough to come up with their own ideas?
The software architect was visibly shaken by this comment. I guess I might have been a bit disconnected, he finally admitted. The problem is that after a while you are asked to work with ideas so much you don't have a good way to get them tested or verified... he stared down, pensively. Sometimes a software architect does neither software nor architecture, it seems.
Little printf left the room, and being done with his visit, exited the building.
